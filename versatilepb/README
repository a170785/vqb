This file contains board-specific information for the ARM Limited
Integrator target boards.  This file documents BSP interface changes
from previous software or hardware versions, and notifies the user of
serious caveats that must be noted before using this BSP.
Additionally, the target board's reference entry (i.e.
versatilepb/target.ref) provides board-specific information necessary
to run VxWorks and should be read fully before this BSP is used.
